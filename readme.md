The growing sphere of deep learning and computer vision is very powerful and enables a number of applications which are
insightful, intuitive, and practical. According to an article by Raj Talluri, Computer vision is fundamental for a broad set of
Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Household monitoring systems use cameras to provide family members with a view
of whats going on at home. Robots and drones use vision processing to map their environment and avoid obstacles
in flight. Augmented reality glasses use computer vision to overlay important information on the users view, and cars
stitch images from multiple cameras mounted in the vehicle to provide drivers with a surround or birds eye view which
helps prevent collisions. The list goes on. 

Albeit, virtual web assistants do not fall into the category of computer vision, the concept of gathering the voice commands that follow directions and send them to a natural voice recognition service in the cloud, which interprets them and sends back the appropriate response, was quite intriguing. This paper takes the same concept, with the modification of an image-based classification, and applies to the realm of home cooking. It looks at predicting delectable recipes, which can be made at the comfort of oneâ€™s home with all the ingredients we have on hands. For any recipe to be tantalizing, the basic ingredients is vegetables. This led to the central theme of this
paper, which is a web and mobile application, NeuralChef, wherein an user can upload images of produce that they have readily available and get an appropriate healthy recipe recommendation in return.
